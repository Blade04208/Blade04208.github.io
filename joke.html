        <p class="scroll">Lets start by giving miles of context. On the 29th of July 2022, Concept Central uploaded a video titled
            "Discord Re-Imagined. (Concept)". I watched this video on its premiere, as I had recently discovered Advan
            and from there, Concept Central, and i really liked their concepts, including this new Discord one.
            <br><br>
            I forgot about it for a while until I found the BetterDiscord theme ConceptCord by BNK. Knowing how
            betterdiscord works, i installed the theme and noticed that there was a few issues with it, such as the font
            being wrong. I made these changes locally, and not knowing that Pull Requests exist on Github, i started
            searching for a discord invite link, as BNKTrollingGroup was a team. The last user i checked, NRD, had an
            invite link to a server titled "Negative Zero". I joined -0 and shared my changes with NRD. NRD, however,
            had nothing to do with the theme, and didn't really care lol. Roughly a month later, NRD created a "new -0"
            sever and gave a 10-member-exclusive invite link to this server. Happening to be online at the time, I hit
            join. I occaisonally chatted and vc'd in there, which was unusual for me for me as i didnt normally chat in
            servers like this. I guess it was because it was "exclusive"? idk. Anyway, when the server opened to
            everyone and the other server shut down, I and the other 10 that got lucky got the "based early access
            members" role, allowing me to talk in #twitter-for-intellectuals, the public non-serious non-announcement
            announcement channel.<br>
            On 29/06/2023, 15:58, NRD hosted a figma party. Figma is an online deign collaboration software. I had never
            used this, but i joined and made a figma account anyway.<br>
            I would come to love Figma and designing as a result of this Figma Party.
            <br><br>
            The "disabling rabbits" joke started when i was scrolling through Microsoft's Fluent Icons, when I found a
            set of animal icons. Ok, makes sense if you wanted like a fluent pet control app. I looked through the list.
            Of the 4 animals, Cat, Dog, Turtle and Rabbit, only the rabbit had a disabled variant, titled
            ic_fluent_animal_rabbit_off_20_regular.svg. I posted this to #twitter-for-intellectuals on 14/07/2023, at
            18:40. Nuclear Winter (the server's local femboy goo ner furry) responded first, saying "Computer, Turn Off
            Rabbit" with a star trek gif of a lizard disappearing. The general -0 community found this funny, and it
            eventually became an inside joke and emoji, :disabled_rabbit:.
            <br><br>
            On 15/06/2023, 18:17, I created a profile picture of the disabled rabbit. The glyph, on top of a darkened
            blurred circle, on top of an iPad wallpaper. NRD said that I should use it, so I did. Some time later, the
            wallpaper was switched to a different iPad wallpaper. This would become my branding across the internet.
            <br><br>
            On 22/08/2023, I, Jeyphr and NRD were in VC making a Weezer blue album meme when we realised I wasn't really
            represented by a character. NRD over those coming days decided to draw what would become my OC: The cliché,
            an anthropomorphic rabbit in a tuxedo.<br>
            Over time, I started to develop a story for him. He was a scientist, doing experiments on rabbits when he
            did a joker transformation ig on accident and now dedicates his life trying to either replicate that
            experiment, or undo it.<br>
            Where does disabling rabbits come into this equation? Well, he can't do this alone, and certainly not
            without funding.<br>
            <br>
            Rabbit Disabler Industries is a company created by Blade to be a front for disabling rabbits. You see,
            through experiments, Blade got a little sloppy and accidentally set a few rabbits free. One of them causes
            the rabbit population to multiply at an even greater exponential rate than they do. Rabbit Disabler
            Industries' job is to make sure the public don't notice the massive influx of rabbits, by disabling them.
            Disabling is defined as "stopped from working", so killing, freezing, stunning, black hole, anything to stop
            them. Think of it as evil Kingsman, "Operating at the highest level of discretion." RDI on the public side
            sells tech products and "Rabbit food (100% poison free*)".
            <br><br>
            The disabled rabbit joke has progressed from joke to pfp to brand identity to OC to personality to the
            Rabbit Cinematic Universe.<br>
            There you go, there's the joke. Now go forth, and disable the rabbits.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            TL;DR Why disable rabbits? Because Microsoft does it.
